Counterfeit Alcohol Detection
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect counterfeit alcohol from images. It is built with ZenML for pipeline orchestration and MLflow for experiment tracking. The goal is to create a reproducible and modular workflow for training and managing deep learning models in a structured MLOps setup.
